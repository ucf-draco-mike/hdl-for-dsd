# Final Project — Week 4

Choose one project (or propose your own with instructor approval).
All projects must include a testbench for at least one nontrivial module.

## Project Options

| Project | Key Concepts | Difficulty |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **VGA Pattern Generator** | VGA timing, counters, ROM, pixel addressing | ★★☆ |
| **Digital Clock** | Counters, 7-seg multiplexing, UART time-set | ★★☆ |
| **Reaction Time Game** | FSM, counters, RNG (LFSR), 7-seg display | ★★☆ |
| **UART Command Parser** | UART RX/TX, FSM, string matching, LED control | ★★★ |
| **SPI Sensor Interface** | SPI master, data formatting, display | ★★★ |
| **Simple 4-bit Processor** | ALU + register file + sequencer + ROM program | ★★★ |
| **Conway's Game of Life** | Block RAM grid, FSM update logic, LED/VGA | ★★★ |
| **Music/Tone Generator** | Counters, frequency dividers, PWM, sequencer | ★★☆ |
| **Stopwatch / Lap Timer** | Precision counters, debounce, 7-seg, UART log | ★★☆ |

## Requirements

1. **Functional demonstration** on the Go Board
2. **Clean module hierarchy** — no monolithic designs
3. **Self-checking testbench** for at least one key module
4. **5-minute presentation**: live demo + architecture diagram + lessons learned

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Functionality | 30% | Does the project work as specified? |
| Design Quality | 25% | Clean hierarchy, parameterization, naming |
| Verification | 20% | Testbench quality, assertions, coverage |
| Integration | 15% | Proper use of learned techniques |
| Presentation | 10% | Clear demo, good architectural explanation |

## Timeline

| Day | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| Day 13 | Project design document due (block diagram + module list) |
| Day 15 | Build day — working prototype or demonstrable progress |
| Day 16 | Final demo and presentation |
