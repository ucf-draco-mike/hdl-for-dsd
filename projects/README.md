# Final Projects

Students select a project on Day 12 and present on Day 16. All projects must include a testbench for at least one nontrivial module.

## Project Options

| Project | Key Concepts | Difficulty |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **UART Command Parser** | UART RX/TX, FSM, string matching, LED control | ★★★ |
| **Digital Clock / Timer** | Counters, 7-seg multiplexing, UART time-set | ★★☆ |
| **Pattern Generator / Sequencer** | RAM, FSM, UART programming | ★★☆ |
| **SPI Sensor Interface** | SPI master, data formatting, display | ★★★ |
| **VGA Pattern Display** | VGA timing, character ROM, frame buffer | ★★★ |
| **Simple 4-bit Processor** | ALU + register file + sequencer/FSM + ROM | ★★★ |
| **Reaction Time Game** | FSM, counters, LFSR, 7-seg display | ★★☆ |
| **Music/Tone Generator** | Counters, frequency dividers, PWM, sequencer | ★★☆ |
| **Conway's Game of Life** | Block RAM grid, FSM update logic, LED/VGA display | ★★★ |

Students may propose their own project with instructor approval.

## Evaluation Criteria

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Functionality | 30% | Does the design work as described? Hardware demo. |
| Design quality | 25% | Clean architecture, appropriate use of FSMs/modules/parameters |
| Verification | 20% | Testbench quality, assertions, self-checking |
| Integration | 15% | Clean top module, proper signal connections |
| Presentation | 10% | Clear explanation, honest reflection |

## Demo Format (Day 16)

5–7 minutes per student:
1. Brief description (30 sec)
2. Live hardware demo (2 min)
3. Architecture walk-through (1–2 min)
4. Verification evidence (1 min)
5. Reflection + Q&A (remaining time)

## Detailed project specifications will be added here as they are developed.
